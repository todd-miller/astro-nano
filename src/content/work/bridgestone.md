I work on an internal engineering platform that facilitates the design and analysis of tires. I have contributed-to and helped design portions of the Python: geometry engine & optimizations, request handling, characterizations (std. measurement library), and the client-side JavaScript: graphics rendering, react-based testing, and state management via both [Redux](https://redux.js.org) and [XState](https://stately.ai/docs/xstate). I have also helped re-engineer the CI & deployment pipelines and led system architecture changes.

In my current role I contribute to high-priority work while also helping to identify feature-gaps, cost-reduction opportunities, and ways to maintain or increase team velocity while working on business priorities.
