## Background

I wanted to start a wiki / blog of some of the small discovery or proof-of-concept work I like to do while thinking through a problem I haven't encountered before. I wanted to create this site as place to write about some of the work I've done to self-advertise, re-work some solutions to solidify the concepts I worked hard to learn, and have a nice personal knowledge base I could reference when encountering something I know I've seen before earlier in my career. [Astro]() was the clear choice of framework for my envisioned goal.

## Priorities

### Primary

- [ ] easy to deploy
- [ ] can immediately start writing content: [blog/05-measurement-tool](../../blog/05-measurement-tool)
- [ ] can embed examples of the code I'm referencing
- [ ] complete control to control every aspect of the site, I'm a web developer after all
- [ ] grab a template or combination of templates
- [ ] typescript, tailwind, deno?

### Secondary

- [ ] link obsidian notes & note generation in a clever way

My entire goal revolved around creating an extremely quick-to-host site that I could just immediately start writing content for. [Astro]() has been pretty fun to start working with. I'm still becoming more and more familiar with collections, using plugins, mdx and embedding dynamic javascript islands (within .mdx posts!). But the lack of a deeper understanding of the framework hasn't stopped me from creating the content I was hoping to create right away. It feels like I'll be able to easily grow into the framework without compromising on any of my priorities, which is a great feeling.
