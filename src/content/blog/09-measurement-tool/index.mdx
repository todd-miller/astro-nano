### Example

Importing a component from a relative path to your content.

This component will display an alert when you click the button.

import MeasurementTool from "./component.astro";

<MeasurementTool />

Nano is an extremely lightweight theme, with no frameworks, so there aren't
any examples of react, vue, solid etc. You can integrate these frameworks using
the guide below, and also use those components in your mdx files.

Don't forget to
use the `client` directive to make them interactive.

```astro
<ReactComponent client:load />
```
